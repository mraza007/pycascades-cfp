## TALK

**Title**: Using Python to Send SMS

**Abstract:**
Sending SMS using APIs can cost money and it can become expensive. Therefore, using python and leveraging simple mail transfer protocol and SMS gateways will be sending SMS without any cost with just your regular email address. This talk focuses on how you can send messages yourself using Python, and how this type of solution works under the hood. We will look into the project, [terminal-text](https://github.com/mtdevss/terminal-text), which demonstrates how you can send messages. Any background of Python from new to experienced are welcome.

**Description**:
I will be talking about how you can use the power of python to send SMS without paying a penny. I will be covering library such as simple mail transfer protocol library (SMTPLIB) and how it can be used to deliver text messages to the recipient with the help of SMS gateways. You will understand how you can leverage SMTP to send text messages and I expect the audience to have beginner understanding of python. I will also be demoing few projects that I created using this idea such as [terminaltext](https://github.com/mtdevss/terminal-text) as this allow you send message from cli to your phone and also 
[server-text](https://github.com/mtdevss/server-text) which allows you run commands on the server(raspberry pi) and it was developed as a fun project.
